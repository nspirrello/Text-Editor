  The Text Editor project was created for Data Structures. The goal of this project was to analyze a large text filea (500,000+) words and calculate its word count, sentence count and syllable count using Regular Expressions in Java with to varying methods and see which was faster. The first method utilized a count reader that used three while loops, one for each count. The second method relied on a more condensed method of one while loop for all three counts. In order to see which analyzer computed large data sets quicker, there is a graphing function implemented to visually see the time taken by each analyzer at 10%,20%,30%...etc of max words.

  This project features a text area for user input. That input is used to calculate the areas word count, sentence count, and syllable count in real time using an EventListener. As well as JavaFx's built in LineChart for the graph.
